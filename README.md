- Activities:
  
Arrived early to set up and prepare.

Recorded meetings and took detailed notes.

Followed up: ex: followed up on getting x policy document for further review as agreed on the interview. Followed up on absent personnel to reschedule or assign a substitution.
 
d.	Analysis

- Objective: Evaluate the controls and determine compliance status.

- Activities:
  
Analyzed all controls against the NIST SP 800-53 requirements.

Disposition of controls:
*   Not Implemented
*  	Not Applicable
*  	Partially Implemented
*   Fully Implemented
   
Compliance assessment:
*   Compliant
*   Not Compliant

   
e.	Post-Audit Reconciliation

•	Objective: Consolidate and analyze the collected data.

•	Activities:

Reviewed all the gathered data to ensure completeness.

Organize the data from notebook to the excel sheet. 

Discussed findings with the audit team to identify any missed items.

f.	Reporting

•	Objective: Compile audit findings into a comprehensive report.

•	Activities:

Created an executive summary of the audit.

Detailed findings on areas of compliance and non-compliance. Included:

1.	Purpose and scope of the audit.
2. 	List of individuals interviewed.
3. 	Results of the audit.
4.  High-level compliance status.
5.  Link to supporting spreadsheets.
6. Provided specific recommendations for compliance improvement, considering budget constraints.

<h2>Notes:</h2>

- The audit can be conducted remotely, highlighting flexibility in the auditing process.

- Emphasized the importance of addressing shadow IT and its implications.
  
- Considered additional frameworks such as CIS Controls for a broader compliance perspective.


<h2>Report: </h2>

a.	Purpose: 

This report evaluates the implementation and effectiveness of the SP 800-53 Revision 5 controls related to Media Protection within the organization. The aim is to ensure compliance with federal standards for security and privacy, thereby enhancing overall risk management.

b.	Scope: Media Protection Controls

The scope of this evaluation focuses specifically on Media Protection controls as outlined in SP 800-53 Revision 5, assessing their application, effectiveness, and compliance within the organization.

|  MP             | Baseline   | Baseline   |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| MP-1: Media Protection Policy And Procedures    |Baseline(s): Low, Moderate, High  |The organization: Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]: A media protection policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the media protection policy and associated media protection controls; and Reviews and updates the current: Media protection policy…|
| MP-2: Media Access | Baseline(s): Low, Moderate, High |The organization restricts access to [Assignment: organization-defined types of digital and/or non-digital media] to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].|
| Purpose and applicability  | Establish controls for systems and organizations that process, store, or transmit information  ||
| MP-3: Media Marking  | 2Baseline(s): Moderate, High  |The organization: Marks information system media indicating the distribution limitations, handling caveats, and applicable security markings (if any) of the information; and Exempts [Assignment: organization-defined types of information system media] from marking as long as the media remain within [Assignment: organization-defined controlled areas].|
| MP-4: Media Storage | Baseline(s): Moderate, High  |The organization: Physically controls and securely stores [Assignment: organization-defined types of digital and/or non-digital media] within [Assignment: organization-defined controlled areas]; and Protects information system media until the media are destroyed or sanitized using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures.|
| MP-5: Media Transport | Baseline(s): Moderate, High |The organization: Protects and controls [Assignment: organization-defined types of information system media] during transport outside of controlled areas using [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards]; Maintains accountability for information system media during transport outside of controlled areas; Documents activities associated with the transport of information system media; and Restricts the activities associated with the transport of information…|
| MP-6: Media Sanitization | Baseline(s): Low, Moderate, High |The organization: Sanitizes [Assignment: organization-defined information system media] prior to disposal, release out of organizational control, or release for reuse using [Assignment: organization-defined sanitization techniques and procedures] in accordance with applicable federal and organizational standards and policies; and Employs sanitization mechanisms with the strength and integrity commensurate with the security category or classification of the…|
| MP-7: Media Use | Baseline(s): Low, Moderate, High |The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of [Assignment: organization-defined types of information system media] on [Assignment: organization-defined information systems or system components] using [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards].|
| MP-8: Media Downgrading | Baseline(s):(Not part of any baseline) |The organization: Establishes [Assignment: organization-defined information system media downgrading process] that includes employing downgrading mechanisms with [Assignment: organization-defined strength and integrity]; Ensures that the information system media downgrading process is commensurate with the security category and/or classification level of the information to be removed and the access authorizations of the potential recipients of the downgraded…|


c.	List of individuals interviewed:

- John Smith, Information Security Officer
- Jane Doe, Compliance Manager

- Michael Brown, Risk Management Analyst

d.	Results of the audit:

Findings:
- Strengths:
  
Effective policies in place for media handling and disposal.

Regular training sessions for staff on media protection protocols.

-	Weaknesses:
  
Inconsistent enforcement of media access controls across departments.

Lack of automated mechanisms for tracking media inventory.

e.	High-level compliance status: 

Overall Compliance: Partially Compliant

Details:
