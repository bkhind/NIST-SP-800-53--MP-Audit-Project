- Activities:
  
Analyzed all controls against the NIST SP 800-53 requirements.

Disposition of controls:
*   Not Implemented
*  	Not Applicable
*  	Partially Implemented
*   Fully Implemented
   
Compliance assessment:
*   Compliant
*   Not Compliant

   
e.	Post-Audit Reconciliation

•	Objective: Consolidate and analyze the collected data.

•	Activities:

Reviewed all the gathered data to ensure completeness.

Organize the data from notebook to the excel sheet. 

Discussed findings with the audit team to identify any missed items.

f.	Reporting

•	Objective: Compile audit findings into a comprehensive report.

•	Activities:

Created an executive summary of the audit.

Detailed findings on areas of compliance and non-compliance. Included:

1.	Purpose and scope of the audit.
2. 	List of individuals interviewed.
3. 	Results of the audit.
4.  High-level compliance status.
5.  Link to supporting spreadsheets.
6. Provided specific recommendations for compliance improvement, considering budget constraints.

<h2>Notes:</h2>

- The audit can be conducted remotely, highlighting flexibility in the auditing process.

- Emphasized the importance of addressing shadow IT and its implications.
  
- Considered additional frameworks such as CIS Controls for a broader compliance perspective.


<h2>Report: </h2>
